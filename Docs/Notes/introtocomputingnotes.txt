###Chapter One###
- All computers, regardless of speed/processing power, compute exactly the same, just at variable speeds
- All problems within the computer are solved by electrons moving from place to place within the machine;
    everything beyond that is abstraction on our part
- a black box model provides no information as to how a task is carried out, only the inputs and the ouputs;
    the black box is assumed to work as intended
- the levels of abstraction are (in order): Problems; Algorithms; Language; Machine (ISA) Architecture; Microarchitecture; 
    Circuits; Devices
- compiers convert from high level languages to something interperitable by the ISA
- cars provide a good analogy for the ISA/microarchitecture relation: the ISA describes what a driver sees as they sit and drive;
    all cars (but not boats or planes) provide the same ISA; what happens under the hood is the domain of the microarchitecture

###Chapter Two###
- computers operate based upon the presence or absence of a voltage between two points (a 1 or a 0)
    - it operates on presence rather than exact voltage simply because this is more difficult to measure
- the "absence" of a voltage simply means a value close, but not necesarily equal to zero; conversely presence merely means
    a value distant from zero
- using this method, given k bits, we can differentiate between 2^k distinct patterns of zeros and ones
- each ISA has its own data types and its own ways of operating on them
- unsigned integers can be represented as strings of binary digits
- much as the decimal digit 329 stands for (3*10^2) + (2*10^2) + (9*10^0), the decimal digit 00110 represents (0*2^4) + (0*2^3) +
    (1*2^2) + (1*2^1) + (0*2^0)

###Key Terms###

Turing's Thesis: Turing's thesis is that every computation van bve poerformed by some such black box (also referred to as a 
Turing machine)

Black Box/Turing Machine: a proposed computer like object which would take some input and produce some output, with no regard
given to the actual processes conducted within this hypothetical machine

Levels of Transformation: the "Levels of Transformation" are the steps gone through to move from electrons up to computers

Analog Machine: analog machines are machines which measure a physical quality, such as distance or voltage

Digital Machine: digital machines are machines which compute by manipulating a fixed, finite set of integers or characters

Algorithm: an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that is guarunteed to terminate

Effective Computability: effective computability refers to the concept that a computer is able to execute a specified command

Microarchitecture: the organization of an ISA implementation is called its microarchitecture

Bit : short for binary digit: a 0 or 1; the absence or presence of a voltage

Data Type: a distinct way of representing data which has specific information encoded within it such that a computer can operate
upon it

Signed MAgnitude Data Type: a data type which is signed using a leading bit

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): a basic logic mechanism which takes two binary bit patterns and producing a bit pattern as its output
which is tthe sum of the input patterns
