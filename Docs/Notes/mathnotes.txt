###Notes###

~Chapter One: Sets and Cantor's Theorem~
- it is possible to have sets which contain other sets, as there is no necesity within a given set for all elements to be of a
    certain type
    - given a set {{1,2},3}, 1 would NOT be an element of the se
- ther eis nothin technically wrong with writing {1,2,3,3}, it is merely redundant and means the same as {1,2,3} as far as sets
    are concerned
- the union operation can only be applied to two sets, so {1,2,3} U 4 wouldn't be technically correct, you would have to write
    {1,2,3} U {4}
    - the same applies to the intersection operation
- set difference is not symmetric, so A-B does not necessarily yield the same result as B-A
- the set symmetric difference is really found by taking A-B, B-A, and then unioning the two resulting sets
- the Z denoting integers has its root in the German word "Zhalen"
- there is some contention within the math world as to whether 0 qualifies as a nautral number
- set-builder notation is a notation which allows for the construction of a set of all elements which match certain criterion
    - follows the general pattern {variable | conditions variable must satisfy}
    - using set builder notation it is possible to define many of the numerical sets; i.e. N = {x|xEZ and x>=0}
    - it can also be used as such: {x|there is an nEN such that x=n/2} or {n/2|nEN}
- it is not necesary that a predicate be confirmable by a computer, it merely must be able to somehow be verified as true or false
- {1}={1,1,1} by the axiom of extensionality, since the axiom makes not point as to ther ebeing the same amount of elements
- any set A is a subset of itself
- a statement such as "if 1=0 then 3=5" is called a vacuous truth. it is considered to be true, as since the first element
    of the assertion, and this was technically allowed by the "if" then the second part of the assertion is irrelevant
    - some other vacuous truths include "Every X has property Y" if there are no X's, and "For any set S, the empty
        set is a subset of S"
        - the latter vacuous proof has the interesting implication that the empty set is a subset of itself
    - a branch of logic called intuitionistic logic arose as a result of dilemmas such as the vacuous truth, which
        assert that every statement must not necesarily be true or false, and vacuous truths are simply neither
- the power set of a given set S is defined as {T|T is a subset of S}
    - the empty set is the power set of the empty set
- the cardinality of some set A is |A|
- the caridnality of a finite set is always an integer
- infinite cardinality is the cardinality of an infinite set
    - counterintuitively, there are more than one infite cardinality values
    - the cardinality of N is N0 (aleph-nought, aleph-zero, aleph-null)
        - this value is larger than all natural numbers
- Cantor's theorm has the implications that, a), there are problems which cannot be solved by computers, and b), there are
    true statements which cannot be proven

###Theorms/Axioms###
axiom of extensionality: if A and B are sets, then A=B precisely when they have the same elements as another
THEORM: |Even|=|Odd|=|N|=aleph-nought
THEORM: The cardinality of the set of perfect squares if aleph-nought
THEORM: if S is a finite set, |S|<|the power set(S)|, since |the power set(S)|=2^|S|

###Others###
- the cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in that set
- two elements are said to have the same cardinality if the elements from the sets can be paired off without there being any
    remaining unpaired elements
- |A|<=|B| prcisely when each element of A can be paried with a unique element of B
    - if |A|<=|B| and |A|!=|B|, then we say |A|<|B|

###Definitions###
set - an unordered collection of distinct elements
element - something contained within a set
empty set - a set which contains no elements
intersection - the set of elements which are held in common between sets
union - the set of all elements contained in either of two sets
set difference - the elements which appear in the first set which do not appear in the second
set symmetric difference - the set of elements contained in exactly on of A or B, but not both
finite set - a set containing a finite amount of elements
infinite set - a set containing infinitely many elements
predicate - a statement about some object x which is either true or false
set-builder notation - the set {x|P(x)} is the set of all x such that P(x) is true
subset - a set such that every element from the set is found within another set (the superset)
superset - a set that every element within the set is contained within another set, as well as potentially additional elements
strict subset - a set where every element from the set is found within some set, and the two sets are not equal
stric superset - a set where every element is found within another set, as well as additional elements not present in the first
vacuous truth - a truth of the form "if P then Q", where P is always found to be false
power set - the set of all subsets of a given set
cardinality - the measure of the size of a set

###Sets###
Z - set of all integers ({...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...})
N - set of all natural numbers ({0,1,2,3,...})
N+ - set of posiitve natural numbers ({1,2,3,...}) (used to explicitely exclude 0, as there is some debate as to whether it 
    qualifies as a natural number)
R - set of all real numbers ({1,1.1,1.11,..}) (incomplete representation of the set, as there is infinite entries between each number,
    and infinite numbers between each one of those infinite numbers)
