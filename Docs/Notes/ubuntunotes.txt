~Notes:
  ~ man xorg.conf contains important information about graphical/desktop setting configuration
  ~ The important components of the xorg.conf are : ServerLayout, Files, Module, Input Device,
    Monitor, Device, Screen
    ~ ServerLayout deals with display and screen layout, and names input devices
    ~ Files deals with session colors and port numbers
    ~ The Module section specifies loadable modules and drivers to load
    ~ The InputDevice section deals with device configuration
    ~Monitor configures the default display device
    >Device provides details about video graphics chipset
    >Screen ties together much of the data from the previous sections
>Lenses are the different filters which can be applied to the Dash
>The launcher is the bar on the left
>The panel is the bar on top
>apt-get will never removes or adds software
>apt's install will sometimes recommend packages to install, to install these say n to continue
    and then reinitialize the install with the suggested package name at the end of the command
>If you run apt-get install with a package you already have installed, apt treats it as apt-get
    update instead
>.tar files (referred to as tarballs) are files which have been compressed using gzip or bzip
> a root user is a user who inherently has super-user priveleges for every command, without having to add sudo
> man pages are stored in places like usr/share/man and usr/local/share/man
> the basic linux directories are ordered as such (can be found with man hier) :
    > / : the root directory
    > /bin : essential commands
    > /boot : boot loader files, Linux kernel
    > /dev : device files
    > /etc : system configuration files
    > /home : user home directories
    > /lib : shared libraries, kernel modules
    > /lost+found : directory for recovered files (if found after a file system check)
    > /media : mount point for removable media, such as DVDs and floppy disks
    > /mnt : usual mount point for local, remote file systems
    > /opt : add-on software packages
    > /proc : kernel information, process cojntrol
    > /root : super user (root) home
    > /sbin :system commands (mostly root home)
    > /srv : holds information relating to services that run on your system
    > /sys : real-time information on devices used by the kernel
    > /tmp : temporary files
    > /usr : software not essential for system operation, such as applications
    > /var : variable data (such as logs); spooled files
> commands in /bin and /sbin are generally statically linked, which means the commands do nbot depend on other
    software libraries residing in /lib or /usr/lib
> most applications are dynamically linked, meaning they require external software to function
> the commands in /bin and /sbin rarely if ever need to be changed, and are intentionally isolated, because this will make
    it easy to see if changes have been made, as this could break the machine
> the user and system data is segregated in order to prevvenet datra loss and makes backing up easier
> in Unix everything is a file: data files, binary filkes, executables, inpout output devices, etc.
> dirctories are ismply files which contains a list of other files and "directories" (more files)
> hidden files (those which begin with a .) are hiudden by default, as they are susually config files and do not need to
    be accessed very frequently
> -l informations columns are as follows : filetype, link count, owner, group, filesize, last access time, filename
> when using ocatl permission codes, 4 denotes read access, 2 denotes write access, nd 1 denotes execute access
> this means that a file with a value of 6 would have read and write, but not execute access
> programs with suid (set user id) or guid (set group id) access are files whcih can be used by any user as root, but
    also pose a security risk for the same reason
> the sticky bit is an additional permission which denotes who is able to rename/link/delete files (1 denoting root, 0 denoting any)
> once something is removed using rm or rmdir, it is not easy/nigh impossible to recover, so be certain you want to delete things
    before you do
> the only way to remove a directory which contains anything is to use rm with the -r switch
> renaming and moving something are the exact same thing in linux
> more was one of the first text pagers in UNIX, but is now simply an alias for less
> deleting an entire machine is as simple as sudo rm -rf /. You are afforded a lot of power. Use sudo with the utmost caution
    > this can be prevented from occuring accidentally by adding the line 'alias rm-'rm --preserve-root'' to .bashrc
> in order for a user to have sudo access, they must be in the suo group and they must be listed in the etc/sudoers file
> if root access is somehow removed, it can be recovered by booting into recovery mode (shift key during boot), select the menu
    entry for root (Drop to Root Shell Prompt), and then solve the problem for there with the root privleges granted
> within a file heirarchy, "leaves" refers to files within that tree, rather than other directories, which are "branches"
> every directory has two special directories . and .., refering to the directory itself and its parent, respectively
> piping is the process of chainging two or more commandling commands together
> cat is how you would output a file to standard ouput, thereby allowing you to string it together with other commands
> multiple files can be output using cat simply by specifying all of their names
> the inode is the absolute location of data
    >all files point to an inode
> a hard link is two files which point to the same inode, meaning that if you modify one file, the other one is also modified
    > this can be useful for backing up files, because if one file is deleted, the hard link will still be pointing to the inode,
        so the data will be retained
> a symlink (symbolic link)/soft link is simply a pointer which will redirect you to a different file
    > this can be useful if you want to sometimes direct to one file, or sometimes direct to another, for example
        a live vs. construction build
> symlinks are used extensively in Linux, for example by deprecated programs to automatically point to their replacements
> tail -f can be used to monitor log files live
