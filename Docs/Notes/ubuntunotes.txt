    -The InputDevice section deals with device configuration
    -Monitor configures the default display device
    -Device provides details about video graphics chipset
    -Screen ties together much of the data from the previous sections
-Lenses are the different filters which can be applied to the Dash
-The launcher is the bar on the left
-The panel is the bar on top
-apt-get will never removes or adds software
-apt's install will sometimes recommend packages to install, to install these say n to continue
    and then reinitialize the install with the suggested package name at the end of the command
-If you run apt-get install with a package you already have installed, apt treats it as apt-get
    update instead
-.tar files (referred to as tarballs) are files which have been compressed using gzip or bzip
