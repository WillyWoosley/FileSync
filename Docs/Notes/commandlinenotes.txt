#Commands#
 ~ pwd : lists current directories filepath
 ~ ../DIR : goes up a directory, and navigates to DIR from there
 ~ touch FILENAME : creates empty file FILENAME
 ~ ls -l : long-format -l output
	~ Columns signify (in order) access rights, # of children, owner, group owner, bytesize, date/time
	last modified, filename
 ~ ls -f : lists by time last modified
 ~ cp : copies a file or directory
 ~ rm -r : removes files recurrsively, i.e. it removes a directory as well as all of its children
 ~ echo : accepts a string as a param and echoes it back to the terminal
 ~ > : pipes standard input into a file, overwriting
 ~ >> : pipes into file, appending
 ~ cat : outputs the contents of a file to the terminal
 ~ < takes standard input from a file and inputs it to the command on the left
 ~ | : pipes the standard output from the command on the left as standard input to the command on the left
 ~ wc : outputs the number of (in order) lines, words, and characters in a file
 ~ sort : sorts standard input alphabetically and outputs it
 ~ uniq : filters out adjacent identical elements from a standard input and outputs it
 ~ grep : searches files for lines that match a pattern and outputs the matches
 ~ grep -i : makes grep case insensitive
 ~ grep -R : greps all files in a directory, including inside files
 ~ grep -Rl : same as grep -R, but for file output only outputs the filename, not the filename and line
	which matches
 ~ sed : takes an input and modifies it based on a passed expression and outputs
 ~ nano : command line text editor akin to vim or emacs
 ~ source : immediately applies the changes from an rc file to the current session
 ~ history : displays all commands given to the terminal in the terminals memory
 ~ env : lists environment variables for the current user

#Environment#
 ~ .bash_profile : file used to store environment settings, loaded on session start
 	~ alias NEW="OLD" : used within rc to define an alias NEW to replace a command OLD
	~ NAME="VARIABLE" : creates an enviroment variable NAME which holds VARIABLE
	~ export : makes an environment variable available to all child sessions
 ~ ~ : denotes home directory
 ~ $ : used ot return an environment variable
 ~ HOME : environment variable which holds the home directory
 ~ PS1 : environment variable which holds the variable defining the makeup style of the command prompt
 ~ PATH : environment variable that holds a list of directories which contain scripts for the 
	commandline to execute
#Notes#
 ~ options can (by default) be strung together (i.e. ls -alt)
 ~ multiple files or directories can be copied to a directory with a single cp command
 ~ multiple files can also be moved into a different directory at the same time as well
 ~ standard input (stdin) is information inputted to the terminal through the keyboard or input device
 ~ standard output (stdout) is information outputted after a process runs
 ~ standard error (stderr) is an error message output by a failed process
 ~ by calling sort and piping the output into unique, all identical elements can be removed, not just
	adjacent ones
 ~ grep stands for "global regular expression print"
 ~ sed stands for "stream editor"
 ~ a sed expression looks like this: 's/BEFORE/AFTER/g', with s signifying substitution, BEFORE signifying
	what should be replaced, and AFTER signifying what it will be replaced with, and 'g' signifying
	that the replace should happen globally (i.e. it should not just replace the first instance of
	BEFORE per line)
 ~ an environment variable is a variable which can be used across commands and programs which holds
	information about the environment
