-The industrial revoltution: 
    -(1) the substitution of machines for humans
    -(2) the substitution of inanimate for animate sources of power
    -(3) the use of new and far more abundant raw materials (substitution of mineral
        and artificial material for animal and organic substances)
-effects:
    -globalization
    -acceleration of technological innovation
        -increased quality of living (not for the "willing tributaries")
            -previously there had been no change in standard of living on a par with what
                was experienced during the Industrial Revolution from the time
                of Homer to the time of Shakespeare (~800BCE-~1600AD)
        -increase in transportation technology means the portion of the world accesible to
            any individual increased drastically
    -drastic population growth
        -previously even marginal population growth meant disaster
        -from 1700 to 2000, populations have increased 12X, and production has increased 100X
-the key factor in the industrial revolution was the introduction of steam power
    -mills had previously existed, but didn't allow for the same sort of explosive growth in production
-Britian birthplace of revolution because:
    -wealthy
        -colonies
    -largest internal economy
    -good infastructure
    -exhausted wood supplies, needed alternative, turn to coal
        -coal much more energy efficient than wood
        -original steam engine built to pump water out of coal mines
            -invented by a man named Thomas Savory
            -Thomas Newcomen improved on this design, bringing horsepower up to 5.5 horsepower
    -relative isolation
-as a result production is able to outpace reproduction, leading to increased standard of living
-benefits (predictably) lead to inequitable distribution of the benefits of this wealth
    -later gives rise to socialism, communism, Marxism
        -seeked to address the question, "why is there such human suffering in the face of
            this unprecedented growth"
-in 1816, a massive volcanic erruption resulted in global cooling, which obfuscated
    the initial effects of global warming
