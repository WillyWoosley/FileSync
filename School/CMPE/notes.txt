~Charles Babbage
    -Father of the computer
    - 1830: Difference engine--used mechanical power
        - calculated mathematical tables
        -smallest imperfections caused errors
        -printed out using a handcrank
        -funded by the British government
    -funding pulled because colleagues thought it wouldn't work
        -conceived of analytical engine
        -son built a model of the machine
        -working version finally built in 1991
-Ada, countess of Lovelace
    - mother of computer programming and the first programmer
    -gifted mathematician
-Herman Hollerith
    - first electrical computer made in 1890
        -used Jacquard's punch cards
            -developed by a French silk weaver Joseph Marie Jaquard
            -holes manually punched into cards to denote what bits do today
        -tabulating machine company merged into IBM in 1924
-Howard Eiken began thinking of modern analytical engine in 1936
-Konrad Zuse completed the first progrmmable general purpose calculating device in 1939
-John Atanoff developed first electronic digital computer (ABC) in 1939
-Howard Aiken completed the Mark 1 in 1944
    -Grace Hopper developed compiler for Mark 1
    -8 feet tall, 55 feet long
    -used electromechanical relays
    -5-6 times faster than a persion
    -information entered using paper tape
-Grace Hopper found first (debatebly) computer "bug," which was a literal bug, forcing them to "debug" the computer
-ENIAC in WWII
    -based off ABC
    -used to calculate trajectory tables for artillery
    -first general purpose computer
-UNIVAC 1 in 1951
    -first general purpose commercial computer
-Von Neumann Architecture
    -Consists of CPU, ALU, Control
    -Memory
    -I/O
    -Model still in used today
-1951-1958 wass the era of Vacuum tubes
    -~ the size of light bulds
    -thousands, which would frequently break down/burn out
        -question was always "is the problem in my program or with the computer"
-1959-1964 saw ithe introduction of the transistor
    -telegraph electronic signals across resistors
    -allowed Assembly
    -1954- FORTRAN, first real "language"
-1965-1970 saw introduction of integrated circuit
    -many transistors grouped (100's-1000's)
    -uses Silicon (a semiconductor)
        -will transmit when certain chemical impurities are introducted into lattice structure
    -Allowed IBM 360
    -made computers affrordable to small and medium scale businesses
    -software industry born, viability of selling software
-1971-Present uses the microporcessor
    -more tighlty bundled integrated circuits
-next generation appears to be SOC, System-on-a-chip generation
    -strive to put everythin onto a single chip
-have gotten to the point where light is too big, need to used ultraviolet light
-MSI?
-Charles W. Kann Introduction To MIPS Assembly Language Programming?
-MIPS?
-X-86?
-IEEE 754 Floating-Point?
-CMOS?
-ALU?
-IBM 360?
